wheelemu adds grab-and-drag panning behavior in every mouse-wheel-enabled application.

Hold a button/key, and mouse movement will become emulated scroll wheel movement.
This version does not consume the mouse movement when it scrolls.  This makes
it feel more like a mobile brower's grab-and-drag behavior.

Remember to enable smooth scrolling in your browser and applications.
Configure values settings inside wheelemu.py to customize behavior and sensitivity.
Set *natural* to True to enable natural scrolling.
